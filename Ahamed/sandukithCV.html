            <h4> Software engineering undergraduate</h4>
            <p class="details">
                I am Sandukith, and I am 21 years old. I schooled at D.S College. <br>
                 I have played the Development role of Student 4 for this Website <br>
            </p>
            <p class="details">
                I was required to create a sitemap depicting the navigation structure of the Website. <br>
                It was required that the sitemap  have navigation links to the appropriate <br>
                part of the group website, and it was also required to be developed in SVG.
            </p>
            <p class="details">
                Task 2 required that I create a page which allows the user to view images. <br>
                This page was required to contain a form, 5 thumbnail images, <br>
                and 2 pull-down menus (to select the page background colour and the page text colour), <br>
                along with an area to display a larger image and associated description of that image. <br>
                It was also required that a corresponding large image and the description <br>
                for that image would display within the defined location on the form, <br>
                whenever a thumbnail was selected, by using MouseOver or radio buttons to select the thumbnail. <br>
