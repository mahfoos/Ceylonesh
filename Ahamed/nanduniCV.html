            <h2> Nanduni Kaveesha </h2>
            <h4> Software engineering undergraduate</h4>
            <p class="details">
                I am Naduni, and I am 20 years old. I schooled at Panadura Sumangala Balika. <br>
                 I have played the Development role of Student 1 for this Website
            </p>
            <p class="details">
                As part of the first task assigned to me I had to prepare the presentation page <br>
                with the title and the names of everyone in the group. After 4 seconds, <br>
                a second page will be displayed connecting to Task 1 of Student 2. <br>
            </p>
            <p class="details">
                Task 2 involved using JavaScript to create the functionality to increase / decrease <br>
                the font size used on the website. It was also required that basic functionality <br>
                should include two buttons - a button to make the font size smaller and a button <br>
                to make the font size larger. Advanced functionality will allow for the <br>
                font size to increase in steps up and down.
            </p>
            <p class="details">
                It was also required that the site contain a form to allow people <br>
                 to buy products related to the topic of our website including: <br>
                Personal details; <br>
                At least 3 different products to choose from; <br>
                A number of items for each product; <br>
                An automatically generated total price of the bill; <br>
                A JavaScript validation to check that the user has filled <br>
                compulsory fields (i.e - personal details, product and number of items). <br>
                It was also required that I not use HTML5 validation for this requirement. <br>
                Additionally, it was also required that the compulsory fields are filled-in, <br>
                when the 'place order' button is clicked, where the user would get a pop-up  <br>
                window with the summary of the order (Eg:- the text in the popup window <br>
                could be something like: "Dear John, you have ordered 2 T-shirts size M at a cost of £20 <br>
                each and a pair of trainers at a cost of £50. Your total bill is £90.")
