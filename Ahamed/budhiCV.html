            <h2> Budhi Shandeepa </h2>
            <h4> Software engineering undergraduate</h4>
            <p class="details">
                The web assignment placed on me required that I create a Main pagebr <br>
                enabling the user to access several parts of the site as <br>
                Task 1. The links should look like buttons and have a hover effect created through the use of CSS.
            </p>
            <p class="details">
                Task 2 required creation of a form to send comments about the website. <br>
                It was required that the form include: <br>
                Input fields for users to enter their details (name, email address etc.) <br>
                A field to enter comments <br>
                A way to enable users to enter a rating through the website <br>
                A JavaScript validation to check that the user has filled-in the compulsory <br>
                fields - 'name' and 'rating', without the use of HTML5 validation <br>
                An HTML pop-up window appearing if the name and ratings are filled-in by a user, <br>
                which includes a summary including the name, any comments and rating given on the form <br>
                (Eg:- if the user entered "John" for their name, rated the site as "good" and <br>
                entered "Very informative website", the popup window should say something <br>
                like: "Dear John, Thank you very much for your feedback. You have rated <br>
                our site as Good and your comment was Very informative website.")
            </p>
            <p class="details">
                It was also required that I support Consistency of style in the website <br>
                using a unique external style sheet file main page and navigation, <br>
                which could be used throughout the website
